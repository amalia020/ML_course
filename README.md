# ML_course
Welcome to my machine learning project! In this project I'm aiming to use advanced techniques in machine learning to analyze stock prices and predict future outcomes. The model used in this project has been trained on historical datasets and has been optimized for the best possible performance. I hope that this project will showcase what I've learned in the Codecademy course: Machine Learning Fundamentals. Please feel free to explore the code and results, and let me know if you have any questions or feedback
